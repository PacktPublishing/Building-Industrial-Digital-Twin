# Azure Digital Twins Explorer
[Azure Digital Twins Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure-samples/digital-twins-explorer/digital-twins-explorer/) (ADX) is used in the book to create the initial Digital templates and instances on Azure Digital Twins Services for the prototype. 

Microsoft [released a hosted, web-based version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/concepts-azure-digital-twins-explorer) of ADX after the writing of the book. It reduces the effort to setup and configure ADX manually as described in the book. It is currently in "preview" statuts. Both approaches are supported by ADX and it is the user's preference on which approach to use.
